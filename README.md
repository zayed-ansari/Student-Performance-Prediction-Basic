# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict student scores based on various demographic and educational factors using regression techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and ElasticNet.
- Data preprocessing includes converting categorical features to numeric and handling missing values.
- Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ².

**Data Source:**
Data sourced from the kaggle dataset, which contains records of student scores and demographic information.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

**How to Run the Project:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

**Future Work:**
- Explore more advanced machine learning models.
- Enhance feature engineering for better prediction accuracy.
